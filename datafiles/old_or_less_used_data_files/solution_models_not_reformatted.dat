                             | and Sect 4 [READ 3] in vdoc.pdf) defines the geometric
                             | shape of the composition space, in this case a right triangular prism.
                             | the following lines list the endmembers that define the 6 vertices of 
                             | this prism. the geometry can be understood by noting that although 
                             | biotite as 3 subcompositions (refer to the occupancy table above), the
                             | site populations on all 3 sites are determined if the population on any
                             | 2 crystallographic sites. the independent "chemical" subcompositions need
                             | not correspond to the actual crystallographic sites, but in this case
                             | M2 and T2 can be identified as sites 1 and 2, respectively. Thus the
                             | species that mix on site 1 are Mg-Fe-Mn, and the species that mix on 
                             | site 2 are AlSi and AlAl. If the endmember with species i on site 1 and
                             | species j on site 2 is written as endmember ij, then the 6 endmembers will
                             | be read in the order: 11, 21, 31, 12, 22, 32
                             | if instead the binary site had been specified as site 1 and the ternary
                             | site as site 2, then the endmembers would be read in the order: 11, 21, 
                             | 12, 22, 13, 23.

mnbi     ann      phl        | endmember names (refer to the above comment, see also Sect 4 [Read 4] in    
mnts_i   sdph_i   east       | vdoc.pdf), by specifying mnbi as the endmember 11 (i.e., the first 
                             | endmember) the model implies that Mn is species 1 on site 1 (M2), and
                             | AlSi is species 1 on site 2 (T2, and, by default, AlAl must be species 2 
                             | on site 2). In this model, there is a remaining degree
                             | of freedom in that the second species on the first site may be chosen as
                             | either Fe or Mg. This degree of freedom is removed by specifying ann as
                             | endmember 21, implying Fe is species 2 on site 1 (M2, and, by default, Mg 
                             | must be species 3 on site 1). [Note that although sdph has Fe on M2 it could
                             | not be specified as the second endmember because it has species 2 (AlAl) on 
                             | site 2.] The order in which the 4 remaining species are entered is determined
                             | by these assignements, thus the third endmember (31) must have Mg on M2 and 
                             | AlSi on T2 (phl), the fourth endmember (12) must have Mn on M2 and AlAl on 
                             | T2 (mnts), etc. Users should be careful to order the endmembers so as to be 
                             | consistent with these considerations, because mistakes may not be detected 
                             | by vertex and can have dire consequences for computed solution properties.

                             | model types 6 and 8 require data defining the
                             | properties of an ordered "species". this species
                             | is defined as a stoichiometric combination of
                             | two independent endmembers and the enthalpy of
                             | formation of the ordered species from the
                             | these independent endmbers. the format for this

                             | the names of these endmembers are arbitrary, but 
                             | here dependent endmembers are highlighted by the 
                             | suffix "_i", this also serves to distinguish the

                             | present in the thermodynamic data file.

                             | on each "chemical" mixing site of the solution (Sect 4 [READ 6] vdoc.pdf).
                             | for each site the compositional "range" of c-1 species (c is the number of 
                             | species on the site as defined in READ 3) is specified as well as a scheme 
                             | for interpreting the range. each range is defined by 3 numbers XMIN, XMAX, 
                             | and XINC, and the scheme is specified by an integer (IMD) written after the 
                             | c-1 ranges. The simplest scheme is cartesian, in which case IMD = 0 and the
                             | the XMIN, XMAX, and XINC indicate the range of compositions (from XMIN to XMAX) 
                             | of the respective c-1 species and the compositional spacing (XINC) of the 
                             | pseudocompounds. As entered above, the subdivision scheme will generate 
                             | pseudocompounds with X(Mn) on site 1 from 0 to 0.20 mol at 0.01 mol increments
                             | for each X(Mn) isopleth, compounds will be generated with X(Fe) from 0 to 1-X(Mn),
                             | where "0" and "1" correspond to XMIN and XMAX in the range for the second species
                             | on site 1, and X(Mg) = 1 - X(Fe) - X(Mn).

                             | Alternative subdivision shemes detailed in vdoc.pdf, may be useful for specialized
                             | applications, e.g., creating models with variable compositional resolution.

                             | By restricting the ranges specified in a model it is possible to focus pseudocompounds
                             | over a particular portion of a solutions composition space, such focusing can be 
                             | computationally advantageous when it is known a priori that only a limited range of
                             | compositions can be stable, but it should be undertaken with caution because the 
                             | results are not always easy to anticipate. 

                             | The primary difficulty in restricting compositional ranges is that the user 
                             | can explicitly control the composition of only c-1 compositions since the 
                             | cth composition is determined by difference. Additionally the subdivision ranges
                             | are applied sequentially, with compositions that violate mass balance (sum of
                             | compositions > 1) eliminated as they occur. Thus, in general, users have the greatest
                             | control on the composition of the first species on a site and no direct control
                             | on the composition of the last species. Since in most cases it is desired to 
                             | restrict the composition of dilute species, endmembers should be specified 
                             | (READ 4) so that the dilute species is not the last species.

                             | Alternative subdivision shemes detailed in vdoc.pdf, may be useful for specialized
                             | applications, e.g., creating models with variable compositional resolution.

                             | By restricting the ranges specified in a model it is possible to focus pseudocompounds
                             | over a particular portion of a solutions composition space, such focusing can be 
                             | computationally advantageous when it is known a priori that only a limited range of
                             | compositions can be stable, but it should be undertaken with caution because the 
                             | results are not always easy to anticipate. 

                             | The primary difficulty in restricting compositional ranges is that the user 
                             | can explicitly control the composition of only c-1 compositions since the 
                             | cth composition is determined by difference. Additionally the subdivision ranges
                             | are applied sequentially, with compositions that violate mass balance (sum of
                             | compositions > 1) eliminated as they occur. Thus, in general, users have the greatest
                             | control on the composition of the first species on a site and no direct control
                             | on the composition of the last species. Since in most cases it is desired to 
                             | restrict the composition of dilute species, endmembers should be specified 
                             | (READ 4) so that the dilute species is not the last species.
