

NOTE: this file echoes the auto-refine data after the exploratory stage. If
the composition of a phase has been relaxed (**warning ver991**) during this stage,
best practice is to modify the appropriate subdivision scheme* and repeat the
exploratory stage calculation until the warnings are eliminated. This process can be
expedited by setting the auto_refine option = man or off

For a summary of the compositional ranges at the end of the auto-refine stage refer
to the console output.
