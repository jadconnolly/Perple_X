# Perple_X

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jadconnolly/Perple_X/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jadconnolly/Perple_X/actions)


This repository contains the latest source code and executables for Perple_X. [Perple_X](https://www.perplex.ethz.ch) is a collection of Fortran77 programs for calculating phase diagrams, thermobarometry, manipulating thermodynamic data, and modeling equilibrium phase fractionation and reactive transport. 

The source code and executables for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** can be downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/jadconnolly/Perple_X/releases/). Installation instructions are [here](https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/perple_x_installation.html "installation instructions").

Executables for all modern operating systems can also be downloaded through the **Julia** package manager. The executables can be used directly from within Julia or, after extraction, as command-line programs. Installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/jadconnolly/Perple_X/blob/main/markdown/julia.md). A basic Julia interface to Perple_X is provided in the [StatGeochem](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatGeochem.jl) package by Brenhin Keller.
