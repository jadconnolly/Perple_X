The MatLab scripts included here demonstrate how 2 and 3D data generated by the 
Perple_X programs WERAMI, FRENDLY and FLUIDS can be manipulated or plotted in MatLab. 

The scripts are:

   perple_x_plot.m                          - plots 2/3D data images.
   perple_x_simple_plot.m                   - perple_x_plot with automatic independent variable choice.
   perple_x_plot_ratio_of_data_in_2_files.m - plots the ratio of 3D data stored in two 
                                              different files.
   perple_x_extract_o_bat.m                 - a program to extract the X-Y coordinates of an
                                              X-Y-Z contour, e.g., an adiabatic or isochoric
                                              path as a function of pressure and temperature.
   pt_2_vs.m                                - switch independent and dependent variables 
                                              for 3D data, to be updated.

The above scripts call functions in the following function scripts, these function scripts must
placed in the same directory as the calling scripts.

   function_for_extract_o_bat.m             - MatLab function to extract a contour.
   function_to_get_perple_x_file.m          - MatLab function script to open and read 
                                              Perple_X tab format files.
   function_for_perple_x_plots.m            - MatLab function script to plot 2/3D data.

To use the scripts: start MatLab, change directory to the directory containing the MatLab script, 
and type the script name (without the .m suffix), the rest is self-explanatory.
