Extract the files to your Perple_X directory. 
   
As of the 7.1.14 Perple_X release, the Perple_X_MATLAB.zip includes
compiled versions of the MATLAB scripts described below. These standalone
versions do not require MATLAB, but do require the free MATLAB Runtime installer, 
see below for instructions.

-------------------------------------
The MATLAB standalone programs included in the archive are:

   MC_fit_plot.exe
   perple_x_plot.exe
   perple_x_simple.exe

Although these programs have the same functionality as the scripts of the same name listed 
below, they are slower and less flexible. The scripts are preferred if a MATLAB
installation is available. The standalone programs function only on Windows and were
compiled with the R2024b(24.2) version of MATLAB. To use these program you must 
download and install the corresponding (free) version of MATLAB Runtime from 
www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

-------------------------------------

The MatLab scripts included in the archive demonstrate how data generated by the 
Perple_X programs WERAMI, MC_fit, FRENDLY, and FLUIDS can be manipulated or plotted in MATLAB. 

The scripts are:

   MC_fit_plot.m                            - plots/analyzes MC_fit pts files.
   perple_x_plot.m                          - plots 2/3D data images.
   perple_x_simple_plot.m                   - plots 2/3D data images, assumes default independent variables.
   perple_x_plot_ratio_of_data_in_2_files.m - plots the ratio of 3D data stored in two 
                                              different files.
   perple_x_extract_o_bat.m                 - a program to extract the X-Y coordinates of an
                                              X-Y-Z contour, e.g., an adiabatic or isochoric
                                              path as a function of pressure and temperature.
   pt_2_vs.m                                - switch independent and dependent variables 
                                              for 3D data, to be updated.

The above scripts call functions in the following function scripts, these function scripts must
be in the same directory as the calling scripts.

   function_for_extract_o_bat.m             - MATLAB function to extract a contour.
   function_for_perple_x_plots.m            - MATLAB function script to plot 2/3D data.
   function_for_MC_fit_plots_I.m            - MATLAB function to plot and analyze the 
                                              MC_fit *central.pts file.
   function_for_MC_fit_plots_II.m           - MATLAB function to plot and analyze the 
                                              MC_fit *perturbed.pts file.
   function_to_get_MC_fit_plot_file.m       - MATLAB function to open and read pts files
                                              that uses MC_fit specific symbol codes
   function_to_get_perple_x_file.m          - MATLAB function script to open and read 
                                              Perple_X tab and pts format files.

To use the scripts: start MatLab, change directory to the directory containing the MatLab script, 
and type the script name (without the .m suffix), the rest is self-explanatory.
